# Logbook

Logbook is a work-in-progress-personal-toy-project that fulfills my mania for recording everything.

It all started when I began recording every train ride in a Google sheet. At one point, my computer scientist instincts urged me to use a relational database instead. So here it is in all of its glory.

The project consists of a Rust backend (featuring [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx)) and a Typescript frontend (featuring [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)). The UI components have been shamelessly stolen from [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/)!

I won't bother to document or explain how to deploy it yet but feel free to contact me.
